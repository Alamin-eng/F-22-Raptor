                    <p class="p">The Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor is an American single-seat, twin-engine, all-weather stealth tactical fighter
                        aircraft
                        developed for the United States Air Force (USAF). The result of the USAF's Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program,
                        the
                        aircraft was designed primarily as an air superiority fighter, but also has ground attack, electronic warfare, and
                        signal intelligence capabilities. The prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, built most of the F-22's airframe and
                        weapons systems and conducted final assembly, while Boeing provided the wings, aft fuselage, avionics integration,
                        and
                        training systems.
                    
                        The aircraft was variously designated F-22 and F/A-22 before it formally entered service in December 2005 as the
                        F-22A.
                        Despite its protracted development and various operational issues, USAF considers the F-22 a critical component of
                        its
                        tactical airpower. The fighter’s combination of stealth, aerodynamic performance, and avionics systems enable
                        unprecedented air combat capabilities.
                    
                        The USAF had originally planned to buy a total of 750 ATFs. In 2009, the program was cut to 187 operational aircraft
                        due
                        to high costs, a lack of clear air-to-air missions due to delays in Russian and Chinese fighter programs, a ban on
                        exports, and development of the more versatile F-35.[N 1] The last F-22 was delivered in 2012. The Next Generation
                        Air
                        Dominance (NGAD) fighter system is expected to be a successor to the F-22.</p>

                        The F-22 Raptor is a fifth-generation fighter that is considered fourth generation in stealth aircraft technology by the
                        USAF. It is the first operational aircraft to combine supercruise, supermaneuverability, stealth, and sensor fusion
                        in a single weapons platform.The F-22 has four empennage surfaces, retractable tricycle landing gear, and clipped
                        delta wings with reverse trailing edge sweep and leading edge extensions running to the upper outboard corner of the
                        inlets. Flight control surfaces include leading-edge flaps, flaperons, ailerons, rudders on the canted vertical
                        stabilizers, and all-moving horizontal tails (stabilators); for speed brake function, the ailerons deflect up, flaperons
                        down, and rudders outwards to increase drag.
                        
                        The aircraft's dual Pratt & Whitney F119-PW-100 augmented turbofan engines are closely spaced and incorporate pitch-axis
                        thrust vectoring nozzles with a range of ±20 degrees; each engine has maximum thrust in the 35,000 lbf (156 kN) class.
                        The F-22's thrust-to-weight ratio at typical combat weight is nearly at unity in maximum military power and 1.25 in full
                        afterburner. Maximum speed without external stores is approximately Mach 1.8 at military power and greater than Mach 2
                        with afterburners.</p>
                        <p class='p'>The F-22's high cruise speed and operating altitude over prior fighters improve the effectiveness of its sensors and
                        weapon systems, and increase survivability against ground defenses such as surface-to-air missiles.The
                        ability to supercruise, or sustain supersonic flight without using afterburners, allows it to intercept targets which
                        subsonic aircraft would lack the speed to pursue and afterburner-dependent aircraft would lack the fuel to reach. The
                        F-22's thrust and aerodynamics enable regular combat speeds of Mach 1.5 at 50,000 feet (15,000 m).The use of
                        internal weapons bays permits the aircraft to maintain comparatively higher performance over most other
                        combat-configured fighters due to a lack of parasitic drag from external stores. The airplane's structure contains a
                        significant amount of high-strength materials to withstand stress and heat of sustained supersonic flight. Respectively,
                        titanium alloys and composites comprise 39% and 24% of the structural weight.
                        
                        The F-22's aerodynamics, relaxed stability, and powerful thrust-vectoring engines give it excellent maneuverability and
                        energy potential across its flight envelope. The airplane has excellent high alpha (angle of attack) characteristics,
                        capable of flying at trimmed alpha of over 60° while maintaining roll control and performing maneuvers such as the
                        Herbst maneuver (J-turn) and Pugachev's Cobra. The flight control system and full-authority digital engine control
                        (FADEC) make the aircraft highly departure resistant and controllable, thus giving the pilot carefree
                        handling.</p>

                        <p class="p">
                        The aircraft has an integrated avionics system where through sensor fusion, data from the radar, other sensors, and
                        external systems are filtered and combined into a common view, thus enhancing the pilot's situational awareness and
                        reducing workload. Key systems include Sanders/General Electric AN/ALR-94 electronic warfare system, Lockheed Martin
                        AN/AAR-56 infrared and ultraviolet Missile Launch Detector (MLD), Westinghouse/Texas Instruments AN/APG-77 active
                        electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, and TRW Communication/Navigation/Identification (CNI) suite. The MLD uses six
                        sensors to provide full spherical infrared coverage.[109] Among the most technically complex equipment on the airplane
                        is the ALR-94 system, a passive radar detector with more than 30 antennas blended into the wings and fuselage for
                        all-round radar warning receiver (RWR) coverage. Its range (250+ nmi) exceeds the radar's and can cue radar emissions to
                        be confined to a narrow beam (down to 2° by 2° in azimuth and elevation) to increase stealth. Depending on the detected
                        threat, the defensive systems can prompt the pilot to release countermeasures such as flares or chaff. The ALR-94 can be
                        used as a passive detection system capable of searching targets and providing enough information for a radar lock on.
                        Tactical communication between F-22s is performed using the directional Inter/Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL).
                    </p>
                    <p class="p">The APG-77 radar has a low-observable, active-aperture, electronically scanned antenna with multiple target
                    track-while-scan in all weather conditions; radar emissions can also be focused to overload enemy sensors as an
                    electronic-attack capability. The radar changes frequencies more than 1,000 times per second to lower interception
                    probability and has an estimated range of 125–150 mi (201–241 km) against a 11 sq ft (1 m2) target and 250 mi (400 km)
                    or more in narrow beams. An F-22 pilot noted that he was able to spot targets from beyond 320 miles away while flying
                    with the AN/APG-77v1.F-22s from Lot 5 and on are equipped with the APG-77(V)1, which provides air-to-ground
                    functionality through synthetic aperture radar mapping and various strike modes.Radar and CNI information are
                    processed by two Hughes Common Integrated Processor (CIP)s, each capable of processing up to 10.5 billion instructions
                    per second. The aircraft has also been upgraded to incorporate an automatic ground collision avoidance system
                    (GCAS).</p>
                    <p class="p">
                        The F-22's ability to operate close to the battlefield gives the aircraft threat detection and identification capability
                        comparative with the RC-135 Rivet Joint, and the ability to function as a "mini-AWACS", though its radar is less
                        powerful than those of dedicated platforms. This allows the F-22 to rapidly designate targets for allies and coordinate
                        friendly aircraft.Data can be transferred to other aircraft via Link 16 using the MIDS-J radio.The IEEE 1394B
                        bus developed for the F-22 was derived from the commercial IEEE 1394 "FireWire" bus system.In 2007, the F-22's
                        radar was tested as a wireless data transceiver, transmitting data at 548 megabits per second and receiving at gigabit
                        speed, far faster than the Link 16 system.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p">
                        The F-22's software has some 1.7 million lines of code, the majority involving processing radar data.Former
                        Secretary of the USAF Michael Wynne blamed the use of the DoD's Ada for cost overruns and delays on many military
                        projects, including the F-22. The integrated nature of avionics has also made upgrades challenging; consequently,
                        open-system architecture for the aircraft is currently planned in order to facilitate future upgrades.

                    </div>
                    <p class="p">The F-22 has a glass cockpit with all-digital flight instruments. The monochrome head-up display offers a wide field of
                    view and serves as a primary flight instrument; information is also displayed upon six color liquid-crystal display
                    (LCD) panels.The primary flight controls are a force-sensitive side-stick controller and a pair of throttles. The
                    USAF initially wanted to implement direct voice input (DVI) controls, but this was judged to be too technically risky
                    and was abandoned. The canopy's dimensions are approximately 140 inches long, 45 inches wide, and 27 inches tall
                    (355 cm × 115 cm × 69 cm) and weighs 360 pounds. The canopy was redesigned after the original design lasted an
                    average of 331 hours instead of the required 800 hours.</p>
                    <p class="p">The F-22 has integrated radio functionality, the signal processing systems are virtualized rather than as a separate
                    hardware module. The integrated control panel (ICP) is a keypad system for entering communications, navigation, and
                    autopilot data. Two 3 in × 4 in (7.6 cm × 10.2 cm) up-front displays located around the ICP are used to display
                    integrated caution advisory/warning (ICAW) data, CNI data and also serve as the stand-by flight instrumentation group
                    and fuel quantity indicator.[124] The stand-by flight group displays an artificial horizon, for basic instrument
                    meteorological conditions. The 8 in × 8 in (20 cm × 20 cm) primary multi-function display (PMFD) is located under the
                    ICP, and is used for navigation and situation assessment. Three 6.25 in × 6.25 in (15.9 cm × 15.9 cm) secondary
                    multi-function displays are located around the PMFD for tactical information and stores management.</p>
                    <p class="p"> The ejection seat is a version of the ACES II commonly used in USAF aircraft, with a center-mounted ejection
                    control. The F-22 has a complex life support system, which includes the onboard oxygen generation system (OBOGS),
                    protective pilot garments, and a breathing regulator/anti-g (BRAG) valve controlling flow and pressure to the pilot's
                    mask and garments. The pilot garments were developed under the Advanced Technology Anti-G Suit (ATAGS) project and
                    protect against chemical/biological hazards and cold-water immersion, counter g-forces and low pressure at high
                    altitudes, and provide thermal relief. Following a series of hypoxia-related issues, the life support system was
                    revised to include an automatic backup oxygen system and a new flight vest valve.</p>

                    <p class="p">The F-22 has three internal weapons bays: a large main bay on the bottom of the fuselage, and two smaller bays on the
                    sides of the fuselage, aft of the engine intakes.The main bay is split along the centerline and can accommodate
                    six LAU-142/A launchers for beyond-visual-range missiles and each side bay has an LAU-141/A launcher for short-range
                    missiles. Four of the launchers in the main bay can be replaced with two bomb racks that can each carry one 1,000
                    lb (450 kg) or four 250 lb (110 kg) bombs. Carrying armaments internally maintains the aircraft's stealth and
                    minimizes additional drag. Missile launches require the bay doors to be open for less than a second, during which
                    pneumatic or hydraulic arms push missiles clear of the aircraft; this is to reduce vulnerability to detection and to
                    deploy missiles during high-speed flight.</p>
                    <p class="p">The F-22 can carry air-to-surface weapons such as bombs with JDAM guidance and the Small Diameter Bomb, but cannot
                    self-designate for laser-guided weapons. Internal air-to-surface ordnance is limited to 2,000 lb (910 kg). An
                    internally mounted M61A2 Vulcan 20 mm rotary cannon is embedded in the airplane's right wing root with the muzzle
                    covered by a retractable door to maintain stealth. The radar projection of the cannon fire's path is displayed on
                    the pilot's head-up display</p>
                    <p class="p">The F-22's high cruise speed and altitude increase the effective ranges of its munitions, with the aircraft having 50%
                    greater employment range for the AIM-120 AMRAAM and twice the effective range for JDAMs than prior platforms.
                    In testing, an F-22 dropped a GBU-32 JDAM from 50,000 feet (15,000 m) while cruising at Mach 1.5, striking a moving
                    target 24 miles (39 km) away.
                    
                    While the F-22 typically carries weapons internally, the wings include four hardpoints, each rated to handle 5,000 lb
                    (2,300 kg). Each hardpoint can accommodate a pylon that can carry a detachable 600-gallon (2,270 L) external fuel tank
                    or a launcher holding two air-to-air missiles; the two inboard hardpoints are "plumbed" for external fuel tanks. The use
                    of external stores degrades the aircraft's stealth and kinematic performance; after releasing stores the external
                    attachments can be jettisoned to restore those characteristics. A stealthy ordnance pod and pylon was being
                    developed to carry additional weapons in the mid-2000s.</p>

                    <p class="p">he F-22 was designed to be highly difficult to detect and track by radar. Measures to reduce RCS include airframe
                    shaping such as alignment of edges, fixed-geometry serpentine inlets and curved vanes that prevent line-of-sight of the
                    engine faces and turbines from any exterior view, use of radar-absorbent material (RAM), and attention to detail such as
                    hinges and pilot helmets that could provide a radar return. The F-22 was also designed to have decreased radio
                    emissions, infrared signature and acoustic signature as well as reduced visibility to the naked eye. The aircraft's
                    flat thrust-vectoring nozzles reduce infrared emissions of the exhaust plume to mitigate the threat of infrared homing
                    ("heat seeking") surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles. Additional measures to reduce the infrared signature
                    include special topcoat and active cooling of leading edges to manage the heat buildup from supersonic flight.</p>
                    <p class="p">Compared to previous stealth designs like the F-117, the F-22 is less reliant on RAM, which are maintenance-intensive
                    and susceptible to adverse weather conditions. Unlike the B-2, which requires climate-controlled hangars, the F-22 can
                    undergo repairs on the flight line or in a normal hangar. The F-22 has a Signature Assessment System which delivers
                    warnings when the radar signature is degraded and necessitates repair. While the F-22's exact RCS is classified, in
                    2009 Lockheed Martin released information indicating that from certain angles the airplane has an RCS of 0.0001 m2 or
                    −40 dBsm – equivalent to the radar reflection of a "steel marble"; the aircraft can mount a Luneburg lens reflector to
                    mask its RCS. Effectively maintaining the stealth features can decrease the F-22's mission capable rate to
                    62–70%</p>
                    <p class="p">The effectiveness of the stealth characteristics is difficult to gauge. The RCS value is a restrictive measurement of
                    the aircraft's frontal or side area from the perspective of a static radar. When an aircraft maneuvers it exposes a
                    completely different set of angles and surface area, potentially increasing radar observability. Furthermore, the F-22's
                    stealth contouring and radar-absorbent materials are chiefly effective against high-frequency radars, usually found on
                    other aircraft. The effects of Rayleigh scattering and resonance mean that low-frequency radars such as weather radars
                    and early-warning radars are more likely to detect the F-22 due to its physical size. However, such radars are also
                    conspicuous, susceptible to clutter, and have low precision. Additionally, while faint or fleeting radar contacts
                    make defenders aware that a stealth aircraft is present, reliably vectoring interception to attack the aircraft is much
                    more challenging. According to the USAF an F-22 surprised an Iranian F-4 Phantom II that was attempting to
                    intercept an American UAV, despite Iran's assertion of having military VHF radar coverage over the Persian Gulf.</p>
